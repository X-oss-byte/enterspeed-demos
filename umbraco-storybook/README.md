## What you'll need

You will need to set up a free Enterspeed account. You can sign up here: https://app.enterspeed.com/signup

Once you have created your account and created a tenant, you need to configure your tenant by setting up:

- Domains and hostnames
- Environment and environment clients
- Data sources

You can read more about it in our getting started guide: https://docs.enterspeed.com/getting-started

You will also need to run a Umbraco server (this can be done locally). Umbraco can be [downloaded here](https://our.umbraco.com/download).

### Ingesting dummy data

Once you have created a data source in Enterspeed, you can start ingesting data. This can be done using our API: https://docs.enterspeed.com/api#tag/Ingest

The demo data used for the Umbraco site can be found here:

- [Umbraco V10 - NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Enterspeed.Demos.UmbracoCms.V10.FairyTales)
- [Umbraco V9 - NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Enterspeed.Demos.UmbracoCms.V9.FairyTales)

**ðŸ’¡ TIP: If you don't want to set up a Umbraco site, you can use our demo data. When creating a new tenant in Enterspeed choose `Pre-populate with demo data`.**

### Setting up your schemas in Enterspeed

The schemas used to transform the data in Enterspeed can be found here: [DEMO DATA](./DEMO-DATA/).
